# Guidelines
This repository contains the guidelines for this github.  This guideline aims to provide clear instructions on how to add scripts to the repository to ensure consistency, collaboration, and effective code management.

#Cloning the github
Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command (Replace "your_username" with your GitHub username):
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Laboratory-of-Evolutionary-Genomics.git

#Branching
Create a new branch to work on your feature or script. Use a descriptive and meaningful name for your branch, like feature/descriptive-name or script/script-name. This helps maintain a clear history of changes.
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name

#Fold structure
Create repositories with your project and place scripts in relevant folders based on their functionalities, such as "analysis," "data_processing," and "utility."

#Coding style
You can use your own styling of coding, however always mention your name at the beginning of the code so future students can contact you if any issues in the code.
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Include comments to explain complex sections of the code.
Golden tip: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python scripts and tidyverse style for R scripts.

#Documentation
Include a Readme file in the repository of you project explaining what you plan to do and the analysis you can find there.
For software, include a readme file explaining what the software does, explain its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any dependencies. Include instructions on how to run the script and examples showcasing its usage.

#Code Review
Expect feedback from other team members during the code review process. Be open to suggestions and improve your script accordingly.
